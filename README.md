# Parkinson-disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, speech, and motor functions. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely treatment and improving the quality of life of patients.

## 📘 Overview
The **Ensemble Learning-Based Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis System** is a data-driven machine learning project designed to accurately predict the presence of **Parkinson’s disease** using patient biomedical voice measurements and clinical data.  
The system leverages **ensemble machine learning algorithms** that combine the predictive strengths of multiple models to achieve **higher accuracy, stability, and reliability** than any single model.

This project explores how **ensemble techniques** like **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Voting Classifiers** can be applied to healthcare datasets to enhance diagnostic decision-making.  
By analyzing subtle variations in vocal frequency, jitter, shimmer, and other biomedical parameters, the model helps in the **early detection of Parkinson’s disease**, which is crucial for timely intervention and treatment.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- 🧩 To develop a robust machine learning system capable of diagnosing **Parkinson’s disease** accurately.  
- ⚙️ To compare multiple models and ensemble strategies for optimal performance.  
- 📊 To enhance model accuracy using **feature scaling, cross-validation, and ensemble integration**.  
- 🔍 To analyze key biomedical features that contribute most to Parkinson’s diagnosis.  
- 🩺 To assist medical practitioners in reliable, data-supported diagnosis through AI.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects motor functions, speech, and overall quality of life.  
Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on **subjective clinical evaluations**, which can delay early detection. With the rise of biomedical data collection (like voice and motion data), **machine learning provides a non-invasive, accurate, and scalable solution**.

However, individual models often face issues such as **overfitting** and **high variance**, which can reduce reliability.  
To overcome these challenges, this project introduces **ensemble learning** — combining the predictions of multiple models to achieve a **more balanced and accurate diagnostic system**.

## 🧠 Concept of Ensemble Learning
Ensemble Learning is based on the principle that **a group of weak learners can form a strong learner**.  
It combines several base models to minimize prediction errors and improve generalization.

### 📚 Types of Ensembles Used:
1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)** — Reduces variance by training multiple models on random data subsets (e.g., Random Forest).  
2. **Boosting** — Improves weak learners sequentially to correct previous errors (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).  
3. **Voting Classifier** — Combines multiple model predictions through majority or weighted voting to make the final decision.

  🧩 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the UCI Parkinson’s Disease Dataset, which contains biomedical voice measurements of patients.
Each row represents a subject’s voice features and whether they are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (status).

🔢 Key Attributes:

MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Fhi(Hz), MDVP:Flo(Hz): Fundamental frequency and variations

Jitter, Shimmer: Measures of frequency and amplitude variation

NHR, HNR: Noise-to-harmonics ratios

RPDE, DFA: Nonlinear dynamical complexity measures

status: Diagnosis label (1 = Parkinson’s, 0 = Healthy)

🧪 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.

Converted categorical data (if any) using LabelEncoder.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train.select_dtypes(['float64', 'int64']))
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test.select_dtypes(['float64', 'int64']))

2️⃣ Model Development

Implemented the following models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

AdaBoost

Voting Classifier (Ensemble of top models)

3️⃣ Model Evaluation

Performance was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Score

4️⃣ Ensemble Integration

voting_model = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('rf', rf), ('gb', gb), ('svm', svm)], 
    voting='soft'
)
voting_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
